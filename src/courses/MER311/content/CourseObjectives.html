				<p>Satisfactory completion of this course should demonstrate that students have:</p></br>
				<ul>
				<ol>
					<li>The ability to identify and formulate elementary level engineering problems related to the structural analysis and failure, in conceptual form as well as in terms of mathematical and physical models;</li>
					<li>The ability to apply the basic principles of mechanics to the analysis structures and failure;</li>
					<li>The ability to understand and effectively communicate the fundamentals of structural analysis and failure theories;</li>
					<li>The ability to effectively generalize the basic axioms of basic elasticity, fatigue, deformation, and buckling; and to extrapolate those concepts to structures not necessarily covered specifically in the course presented; and</li>
					<li>Use modern engineering tools for the analysis of structures.</li>
			   </ol>
