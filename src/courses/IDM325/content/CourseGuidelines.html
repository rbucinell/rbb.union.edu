    is an opportunity to shine and to share. This class is a social compact â€“ we will learn together, and we will
    all contribute.

<h3>RPI Venture BPlan Presentations</h3>
<p>RPI sponsors a business plan presentation series that meets from 7:30 â€“ 9AM with continental breakfast at
    7:30AM. Driving directions are available at <a href="http://www.venturebplan.com/">http://www.venturebplan.com/</a>.
    <br>
    An overview of the Venture Bplan Series at RPI:
    <br>
    The Venture Bplan series is Tech Valleyâ€™s premier monthly venture forum. Each month, two start-up technology
    ventures are invited from across the region to present their business plans and financial needs before a panel
    of investors and a general audience. The events attract an audience of a hundred or more attendees each month,
    including investors, entrepreneurs, students, faculty, and members of the business community.<br>
    Center for Economic Growth and Incubator Staff take presenting companies through a rigorous coaching process
    before the event. Businesses at the beginning of the equity fund raising process are especially encouraged to
    become involved. A panel of professional investors provide questions and feedback on the presentations as do a
    formal group of area consultants after the event. Presenting companies are invited to apply to the Tech Valley
    Angel Network forum at half off the usual application fee. Of the many companies that have presented to date,
    35% have subsequently received equity funding.

<h3>Journal</h3>
<p>
    The course is about much more than creating a business plan to commercialize a new and innovative
    product. It is also about transforming you into an entrepreneur who takes control of her/his education and life
    to make your passion reality. Think of yourself as the CEO of your future.<br>
    <br>
    Absolutely everything that we study in the context of making a product a commercial success is applicable to
    making your passion a reality. The analogy is to think of yourself and your dreams as the product.&nbsp; The
    business plan is a strategy to make your dreams a success.<br>
    <br>
    As you read the material, do the assignments, participate in discussions, encounter inspiring ideas in class (or
    out of class), keep a journal in which you transform the business context to your personal context. At a
    minimum, every assignment should have a journal counterpart. This includes the final business plan. You will
    leave this course with a business plan for your life â€“ make it a good (and ethical) one!<br>
    <br>
    Your journal should be typed. Ron and Hal will collect your weekly journal entrees periodically.
</p>

<h3>The Black Quad Ruled Composition Book</h3>
<p>
    You will keep notes in a black composition book with graph paper ruling. The black composition book is a
    trademark for engineers. It is an organizing device to keep track of important developments and ideas. There is
    so much important material in this course, we expect you to fill at least one composition book. <br>
    <br>
    Your black composition book should include:</br>
    Class notes<br>
    Group meeting notes<br>
    Reading notes<br>
    Mentor meeting notes<br>
    Brilliant ideas that occurred to you in the shower <br>
    <br>
    Ron and Hal will collect your journals at random points throughout the term. It should always be up to
    date.
</p>

<h3>Business Vision Plan</h3>

    plan competition. Presentations will be limited to ten slides. Elevator pitches will be limited to one
    minute. 
    <br>
    There will be external judges, prizes and festivities.
