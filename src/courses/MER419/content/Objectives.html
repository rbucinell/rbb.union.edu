This working knowledge should consist of an intuitive understanding of how the machine elements work, the ability to select parts from the catalogues and analyze them, and the ability to integrate those parts into the design of a complex mechanical system.</li>
	<li>Gain experience designing mechanical systems to meet desired needs.</li>
	<li>Learn how to effectively apply engineering tools to open-ended problems.</li>	
	<li>Develop a greater apperciation for design for manufactur considerations.</li>
	<li>Learn how to learn on your own.</li>
	<li>Gain additonal experience working in teams.</li>
	<li>Learn how to identify a less than optimal situation that can be improved through the design of a basic machine.  This includes understanding how to understand the less than optimal situation through the eyes of the end user.</li>
	<li>Gain experience working with, communicating with, and presenting to outside organizations.</li>
