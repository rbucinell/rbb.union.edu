<ul>
	<ol start=1 type=i>
		<li>A lab notebook is to be kept that is bond with numbered pages and must contain the following information for each project in this course (you can use a notebook from another course) </li>
			<ol start=1 type=a>
				<li>Summaries of all synthesis exercises</li>
				<li>All calculations related to the design of the project</li>
				<li>Team meeting summaries</li>
				<li>Summaries of all outside consultations</li>
				<li>Concept sketches</li>
				<li>All activities related to the project</li>
			</ol>
		</li>
		<li>Each student is expected to be a full participant in the project and have responsibility for an equal share of the work load in their project team.</li>
		<li>Each student team is required to develop and submit a project plan that will contain at he minimum the following milestones:
			<ol start=1 type=a>
				<li>Mid-Term project review/presentation</li>
				<li>Final project presentation</li>
				<li>Preliminary Design</li>
				<li>Preliminary project demonstration</li>
			</ol>
		</li>
		<li>Reports are due on the date specified on the Assignment page.
			<ol start=1 type=a>
			<li>Reports are due at the start of class on the date due.</li>
			<li>Reports turned in after after the start of class, before 7pm, on the date due will receive a -5pt deduction out of 10pts.</li>
			<li>Homework turned in after 7pm on the date due will receive -15pt deduction out of 10pts..</li>
			</ol>
		</li>
		<li>Reports may be subjected to peer review</li>
		<li>Each team is to write one report that is the responsibility of each team member. </li>
		<li>Instances of  academic dishonesty will be reported in accordance to the Union College Honor Code.  Examples of academic dishonesty on lab reports includes:
			<ol start=1 type=a>
				<li>Wrote copying of any part of report or notebook from another student without properly referencing the copied material.</li>
				<li>Copying of information, including tables and figures, from other sources without properly referencing the source of the information.</li>
			</ol>
		</li>
		<li>Failure to participate in the project, keep a notebook, or turn not turn in a report will result in failure of the course. </li>
		<li>All cell phones and pagers are to be turned off during class lectures.  Cell phones or pagers going off or being used in class will result in the reduction of the students course grade by one grade increment (i.e., B to a B-).  </li>
		<li>Using computers or another device during lecture for instant messaging, email communication, web surfing, game playing, or any other activity not directly related to the lecture or laboratory will result in the reduction of the students course grade by one grade increment (i.e., B to a B-). </li>
		<li>Do not bring food to lecture.</li>

<h5>COURSE TREBUCHET COMPETITION</h5>
	
<ul>
	<ol start=1 type=i>
		<li>Competition Constraints</li>
			<ol start=1 type=a>
				<li>Maximum weight used to propel arm cannot exceed 1.00kg.</li>
				<li>Weights from the course weight sets can be used.</li>
				<li>Course weight set weights cannot be altered.</li>
				<li>The total vertical displacement of the 1.00kg mass cannot exceed 12 inches.</li>
				<li>The trebuchet arm (including everything other than the 1.00kg mass) cannot add energy to the propulsion of the projectile.</li>
				<li>Before the 1.00kg mass is added to the arm at competition, the arm will be positioned in the horizontal position and let go. The weighted end must rise about the pivot while the throwing end should drop.</li>
				<li>The trebuchet arm must include a box, hook, or other weight hanging method to attach the hanging mass.</li>
				<li>The pivot point of the trebuchet arm cannot start more than 12 inches off the ground.</li>
				<li>The trebuchet must be activated by a mechanical release mechanism.</li>
				<li>The projectile for the competition will be a golf ball.</li>
				<li>Purchased kits or online blueprints are off limits.</li>
			</ol>
		</li>
		
		<li>Competition Scoring
			<ol start=1 type=a>
				<li>Each team must present their calculations for the maximum distance that their trebuchet will throw the projectile.</li>
				<ol start=1 type=i>
					<li>Calculations must be prepared in a formal homework format.</li>
					<li>One set of calculations per team are to be turned in.</li>
					<li>Be sure to clearly identify the teams prediction.</li>
				</ol>
				<li>Maximum Distance Thrown</li>
				<ol start=1 type=i>
					<li>Each team will be given 3 trials.</li>
					<li>The Maximum of the three trials will be used to compare with the theoretical calculations.</li>
				</ol>
				<li>Maximum Average Distance Thrown</li>
				<ol start=1 type=i>
					<li>Each team will be given 3 trials.</li>
					<li>The Average of the three trials will be used to compare with the theoretical calculations.</li>
				</ol>
