                The success of bast plants (e.g., hemp, jute, kenaf, flax) in industrial and technical applications is 
                completely a function of how they compare to other plant-based and synthetic materials on a cost and performance basis. 
                The Center for Bio-industrial Materials Institute (BMI) has the mission of collaboratively establishing a 
                comprehensive understanding of bio-industrial materials from bast plants (both hurd and fiber), their opportunities, and 
                how to economically process them into useful products, through partnerships to increase their competitiveness and material use.

            <summary>
                Today, Anterior Cruciate Ligament (ACL) tears are one of the most prevalent knee injuries, with the occurrence of 
                ACL tears increasing drastically from approximately 80 000 in 2000 to 150 000 in 2011. Although there are many factors that 
                contribute to an ACL tear occurring, certain environmental factors could contribute to the dramatic increase over the past couple 
                decades, especially in athletes. This study explores two of these possible factors; the playing surface and the type of shoes worn 
                by soccer players. The effects these factors have on ACL tears were evaluated by measuring the maximum torque achieved prior to the 
                shoe breaking free of the playing surface using a servo-hydraulic bi-axial load frame.

                Patient specific implants are becoming viable treatment options in some orthopaedic applications through advances in additive 
                manufacturing and 3D printing techniques. One potential application is for treatment of segmental bone defects, particularly in patients 
                suffering from bone cancer. Current treatment options are: Amputation, megaprosthesis, or allografts. These treatments are often highly 
                invasive, may require a partial/full joint replacement and are limited by mechanical properties, which affect the life of the implant. 
                The Ti6Al4V implant proposed in this research was designed to fit a mid-diaphyseal segmental bone defect, mimic the mechanical properties of bone, 
                facilitate osseointegration and reduce wear at the bone-implant surface.

                details. This pattern was then used in conjunction with three dimensional Digital Image Correlation (DIC) to measure full field deformations of the heart 
                through several cardiac cycles. These deformations were measured with a spatial resolution of approximately 0.4 ÔÅ≠m and temporal resolution of 50 Hz

        <project name="MEASURING DEFORMATIONS ON COLOBINE MANDIBULAR SYMPHYSIS">
            <summary>
                The masticatory loading regime of lateral transverse bending (wishboning)is hypothesized to be instrumental in the evolution of symphyseal form
                among primates. The biomechanics of wishboning have largely been inferred by assuming that the mandible behaves as a curved beam under 
                this load; however, the characterization of stress and strain in the anthropoid symphysis has been interpretively challenging. This is due, in part, 
                to both limitations of sampling strain in an in vivo context and the incongruence of beam theory assumptions on the one hand, and the anatomical 
                complexity of mandibular morphology on the other. Utilizing three-dimensional (3D) Digital Image Correlation (DIC), we employ an in vitro 
                approach to characterize the strain field in a sample of colobine mandibles under simulated wishboning loads in order to assess the utility of 
                idealized curved beam models for characterizing strain gradients in symphyseal bone.

        <project name="ISOGRID DEVELOPMENT">
            <summary>
                Isogrid structures are made up of a lattice or ribs oriented in an equilateral configuration that give the structure isotropic characteristics.  
                Metallic isogrids were found to be extremely efficient (load bearing capability with respect to weight); however, very costly to manufacture.  
                Isogrid structures fabricated from composite materials were able to take advantage of the extreme anisotropy of continuous carbon fibers to increase 
                structural efficiency well above metallic isogrids.  Most of the applications the successfully used composite isogrids were filament wound and took 
                advantage of winding tension to flatten the fiber tows at intersections that allowed deleterious build-up in thickness to be avoided.  Because of the 
                use of the need for winding tension, flat composite isogrids were found to be extremely difficult and impractical to produce using filament winding 
                techniques.  This study explores the production of flat composite isogrids that eliminates build-ups at intersections, does not rely on winding tension, 
                and maintains the advantageous structural efficiency of isogrids.

                One of the most important issues in composite material design is joining composite structures to other materials.  Conventional joint of 
                fasteners can at best yield a joint that is 40 percent efficient.  Bonded and fastened joints also have to account for significant differences in thermal 
                expansion coefficients that give rise to high residual stresses if the structure is subjected to temperature variations.  The Composite Material and Mechanics

            <summary>
                In traditional homogenous materials, failure results from the propagation of a single crack. In composite materials cracks (both 
                inter-laminar matrix cracking, intra-laminar matrix cracking, and fiber breaks) form throughout the material during its life cycle and failure 
                results from the accumulation of these various types of damage.  This process is dependent on fiber architecture, materials used, and structural 
                geometry.  A thorough understanding of damage accumulation is critical to structural assessment.  Traditional characterization of laminated composite 
                materials occurs on flat coupons.  The free edges of the flat laminated composite coupons give rise to an exacerbated interlaminar state of stress 
                that dominate the formation of damage.  Many composite structures are of a closed form configuration that do not have free-edges.  Traditional 
                coupons do not accurately characterize the performance of closed form laminated structures.   For this reason a new specimen configuration and test 
                procedure was developed to study the accumulation of damage in closed cross-section composite structures under static and fatigue loading.

                The Composite Manufacturing and Mechanics labs include spaces for student innovation and have a long history of supporting student innovation.  
                Some students come to college with a deep passion, develop an interest through their studies, or are just curious enough about a particular topic that a project develops. 
                These are the seeds of future innovation and the student innovation spaces help students develop the confidence that will lead to a career of innovation.  Student 
                motivated projects include development of a torsional load cell, a six-degree-of-freedom load platform, a tensile stage for a microscope, a electro-magnetic 
                actuated load frame for studying spinal segments, an innovative integrated bike frame and suspension, an adjustable sled hockey frame, and an adjustable prosthetic.

        <project name="INTERNATIONAL STUDENT PROJECTS">
            <summary>
                Engineering has evolved into a global enterprise where projects routinely involve international collaborators. To help prepare students for the 
                internationalization of engineering, several programs were created to give Union College engineering students international engineering project experiences.  
                The International Virtual Design Studio (IVDS) project is a collaboration with the Middle East Technical University in Ankara, Turkey; Altim University in Ankara, 
                Turkey; and ESIGELEC in Rouen, France.  IVDS teams Union College engineering students with international students to remotely work on a project as a team.  IVDS typically 
                runs between six and nine months and includes a visit to the US by the international students and a visit to the collaborating institution by the Union College students.  
                Additionally, Union College has chapters of Engineers Without Borders (EWB) and Engineers for a Sustainable World (ESW) which have led to international design projects to 
                sustainability support communities in the developing world.
