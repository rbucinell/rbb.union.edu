The Composites Manufacturing lab is located on Union College's Campus in Butterfield Hall, Room 100.  This facility is used for manufacturing composite materials, 
materials research, supporting student projects, and sometimes used to support laboratory components of courses taught at the College. 
The lab was built, furnished, and equipped through funding from federal, state, and corporate grants.</br></br>

This lab features two tetrahedron hot presses (40 ton/600&#176F and 50 ton/850&#176F), a Fisher Research Autocalave (17"dia x 48" length/450&#176F/150 psi), 
DelTech Top Hat Furnace (1550&#176C), Precission Scientific Vacuum Oven Model 19 (200&#176C) and four vacuum pumps for materials processing.  The lab also houses a 
a -20&#176C freezer for material storage, material racks, a tile saw, a band saw, two drill presses, and an assortment of tools for fabricating composite materials. </br></br> 

This lab is the home of the Faxtron MX-20 X-Ray Radiography system, an assortment of air-brushes (used to place DIC speckles on specimens), two small air compressors for airbrushing, 
and a fume hood.  The lab also has a station set up for strain gauge attachment and electronics evaluation.
