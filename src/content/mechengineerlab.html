                <p class="card-text">
                    The Engineering Mechanics lab is located on Union College's Campus in Butterfield Hall, Room 101.
                    This facility is used for
                    materials research, supporting student projects, and sometimes used to support laboratory components
                    of courses taught at the College.
                    The lab was built, furnished, and equipped through funding from federal, state, and corporate
                    grants.
                    </br></br>
                    The lab featrues two electo-mechanical load frames (10 kip and 20 kip capacity), one servo hydraulic
                    tensile load frame (100kip),
                    one servo hydraulic tension-torsion load frame (22kips-100,000in-lb capacity), two tensile stages
                    (SEM: 5 grams-100 lb; Optical Microscope: 5 grams-100 lb), and a servo-hydraulic torsion frame.
                    There are multiple load cells for each load frame and four electronic extensometers. The lab also
                    features three 3-D Digitial Image Correlation (DIC) systems for measuring deformation,
                    one Electronic Special Patern Interferometer (ESPI), two microscopes with cameras (white light,
                    polarized light, infrared, and inverted), Image Pro Plus imaging software,
                    four channel acoustic emission system, three channel ultrasonic system, 10 channel Vishey 5000
                    electronic strain gauge conditioning system with five
                    A/D channels, 8 channel Vishey System 8000 electronic strain gauge conditioning system, two RR Mohr
                    Machines, optics bench, bench optics, multiple light sources, and a lot of legos. In the adjacent
                    Composite Manufacturing laboratory is a Faxtron MX-20 X-Ray Digital Radiographic System.</p>
