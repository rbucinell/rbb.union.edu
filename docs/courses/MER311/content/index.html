<h2>Honor Code Statement</h2>
<p>
	The  highest levels of ethical behavior are required of those in the profession of  engineering and, by extension, of those preparing themselves to enter the  profession. Furthermore, ethical behavior, especially in the area of  academic honesty, is critically important to the entire educational and  academic mission of the College. Therefore the Mechanical Engineering  Department takes matters of academic dishonesty and cheating very seriously.</br></br>
	To foster and enforce the highest standards of academic honesty, the ME Department  fully supports Union's Honor Code and Honor Council. Specifically,  Union's academic honor code requires that &quot;Any suspected violations of the  Honor Code must be reported ...&quot; All Mechanical Engineering faculty  will strictly adhere to this guidance.Any suspected  violations of the honor code will be reported. The honor  code further states: &quot;Normally, for a first violation of the Honor  Code, a student wouldfail the course.&quot; Because of the  importance of honesty and ethics in engineering, the Mechanical Engineering  Department understands and supports the significant penalties outlined in the  honor code for academic misconduct.</br></br>
	Further  information on Union's honor code can be found here: <a href="http://honorcode.union.edu/">honorcode.union.edu</a>.</br></br>
	Remember, it is your responsibility to understand and comply with  instructions for what sorts of study aids, references, outside resources,  and/or collaboration are allowed and disallowed for each assignment in each  course. Ignorance of what is disallowed is not a defense.
