<h2>Honor Code Statement</h2>
<p>The highest levels of ethical behavior are required of those in the profession of engineering and, by extension, of
	those preparing themselves to enter the profession.&nbsp; Furthermore, ethical behavior, especially in the area of
	academic honesty, is critically important to the entire educational and academic mission of the College.&nbsp;
	Therefore the Mechanical Engineering Department takes matters of academic dishonesty and cheating very
	seriously.</br></br>
	To foster and enforce the highest standards of academic honesty, the ME Department fully supports Union's Honor Code
	and Honor Council.&nbsp; Specifically, Union's academic honor code requires that &quot;Any suspected violations of
	the Honor Code must be reported ...&quot;&nbsp; All Mechanical Engineering faculty will strictly adhere to this
	guidance.&nbsp;Any suspected violations of the honor code will be reported. &nbsp;The honor code further
	states:&nbsp; &quot;Normally, for a first violation of the Honor Code, a student would&nbsp;fail the course.&quot;
	Because of the importance of honesty and ethics in engineering, the Mechanical Engineering Department understands
	and supports the significant penalties outlined in the honor code for academic misconduct.</br></br>

	Remember, it is your responsibility to understand and comply with instructions for what sorts of study aids,
	references, outside resources, and/or collaboration are allowed and disallowed for each assignment in each
	course.&nbsp; Ignorance of what is disallowed is not a defense.
