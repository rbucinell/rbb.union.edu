<p>Satisfactory completion of this course should demonstrate that students have:</p>
<ul>
	<ol>
		<li>The ability to identify and formulate elementary level engineering problems related to dynamic structures, in conceptual 
		form as well as in terms of mathematical and physical models;</li>
		<li>The ability to apply the basic principles of mechanics to the analysis of dynamic structures;</li>
		<li>The ability to understand and effectively communicate the fundamentals of dynamic analysis and synthesis;</li>
		<li>The ability to effectively generalize the basic axioms of dynamics, and to extrapolate those concepts to 
		structures not necessarily covered specifically in the course presented;</li>
		<li>Gain a physical understanding of the mechanics of dynamic structures.</li>
		</ol>
