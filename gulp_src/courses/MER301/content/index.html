<h2>Honor Code Statement</h2>
<p>The  highest levels of ethical behavior are required of those in the profession of  engineering and, by extension, of those preparing themselves to enter the  profession.&nbsp; Furthermore, ethical behavior, especially in the area of  academic honesty, is critically important to the entire educational and  academic mission of the College.&nbsp; Therefore the Mechanical Engineering  Department takes matters of academic dishonesty and cheating very seriously.</br></br>
To  foster and enforce the highest standards of academic honesty, the ME Department  fully supports Union's Honor Code and Honor Council.&nbsp; Specifically,  Union's academic honor code requires that &quot;Any suspected violations of the  Honor Code must be reported ...&quot;&nbsp; All Mechanical Engineering faculty  will strictly adhere to this guidance.&nbsp;Any suspected  violations of the honor code will be reported. &nbsp;The honor  code further states:&nbsp; &quot;Normally, for a first violation of the Honor  Code, a student would&nbsp;fail the course.&quot; Because of the  importance of honesty and ethics in engineering, the Mechanical Engineering  Department understands and supports the significant penalties outlined in the  honor code for academic misconduct.</br></br>
Further  information on Union's honor code can be found here:&nbsp; <a href="http://honorcode.union.edu/">honorcode.union.edu</a>.</br></br>
Remember, it is your responsibility to understand and comply with  instructions for what sorts of study aids, references, outside resources,  and/or collaboration are allowed and disallowed for each assignment in each  course.&nbsp; Ignorance of what is disallowed is not a defense.</p>

        <p></p>The apple on the top of the tree</p>

        <p></p>So take an example from Eve,</p>
        <p></p><strong>Experiment</strong>.</p>
        <p></p>Be curious,</p>
        <p></p>Though interfering friends may frown.</p>
        <p></p>Get furious</p>
        <p></p>At each attempt to hold you down.</p>
        <p></p>If this advice you always employ</p>
        <p></p>The future can offer you infinite joy</p>
