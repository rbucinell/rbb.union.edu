    <font size="2"><span style="font-family: Verdana">A basic engineering course 
    required in the mechanical engineering curricula.&nbsp; Strength of materials is 
    a branch of applied mechanics that deals with the behavior of solid bodies 
    subjected to various types of loading.&nbsp; The social bodies considered in 
    this course include axially-loaded members, shafts in torsion, thin shells, 
    beams, columns, and structures that are assemblies of these components.&nbsp; 
    Strength of materials analysis determines the stresses, strains, and 
    displacements produced by the loads.&nbsp; Classroom lectures are supplemented 
    with demonstrations.&nbsp; Includes a laboratory where students build an 
    appreciation for the phenomenon being discussed in lecture.&nbsp; Prerequisite:&nbsp; 
    MER212.</span></font></p>
