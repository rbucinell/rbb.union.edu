<div id="content_pane">
	<p>A basic engineering mechanics course concerned with the kinematics and kinetics of non-deformable particles and two dimensional bodies 
	undergoing acceleratory motion. Free body diagrams, Newtonian mechanics, energy approaches, vectors and the calculus are used 
	to solve problems throughout the course. Topics include kinematics, force and acceleration, work and energy principles and impulse and 
	momentum principles. Includes a design component.</br></br>
	Prerequisite(s): MER 201 & (MTH 115 or IMP 121)</br></br>
	Common Core Designation: SET</br></br>
	Credits and Contact Hours: 1 Union Course Credit. Offered during a Union Standard Lecture Slot (Either 3 times weekly for 65 minutes 
	or twice weekly for 105 minutes); design project studio period offered either biweekly for 130 minutes or weekly for 65 minutes 
	(choice of instructor)</br></br></p>
