		<p>Satisfactory completion of this course should demonstrate that students have:</p></br>
		<ul>
			<ol>
				<li>The ability to identify and formulate elementary level engineering problems related to static structures, in conceptual 
				form as well as in terms of mathematical and physical models;</li>
				<li>The ability to apply the basic principles of mechanics to the analysis of static structures;</li>
				<li>The ability to understand and effectively communicate the fundamentals of static analysis and synthesis;</li>
				<li>The ability to effectively generalize the basic axioms of statics, and to extrapolate those concepts to 
				structures not necessarily covered specifically in the course presented;</li>
				<li>Gain a physical understanding of the mechanics of static structures.</li>
