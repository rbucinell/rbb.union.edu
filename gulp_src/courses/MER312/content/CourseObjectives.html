<p>Satisfactory completion of this course should demonstrate that students have:</p>
<ol>
	<li>The ability to identify and formulate elementary level engineering problems related to the analysis and
		synthesis of mechanisms, in conceptual
		form as well as in terms of mathematical and physical models;</li>
	<li>The ability to apply the basic principles of mechanics to the analysis and synthesis of mechanisms;</li>
	<li>The ability to understand and effectively communicate the fundamentals of mechanism analysis and synthesis;</li>
	<li>The ability to effectively generalize the basic axioms of classical mechanism design and synthesis, and to
		extrapolate those concepts to
		mechanisms not necessarily covered specifically in the course presented;</li>
	<li>Gain additional experience working in teams.</li>
	<li>The ability to generate an algorithm to solve a mechanism synthesis or analysis problem; and</li>
	<li>Use modern engineering tools for the synthesis and analysis of mechanisms.</li>
